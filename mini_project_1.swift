 # Mini Project 1
 
  Today, you'll be creating a `Vehicle` `struct`.  The `struct` should store information on the
   vehicle's make, model, color, gas milage, type (truck, sudan, etc.), and current fuel level.
 
  The `struct` should include methods that:
 
   - Fill the gas tank up completely
   - Drive a certain number of miles (if it has enough fuel), and deducting the fuel accordingly after the drive.
     The vehicle will not drive if it doesn't have enough fuel (and will print an error message).
 
   As part of the project, I'll be looking for :
    
    - Proper use of git branches and merge requests
    - Proper documentation
    - Proper code style

struct Vehicle {

    var gasMileage: Double
    var type: String
    var currentFuelLevel: Double
